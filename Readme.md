Eventra is a full-featured backend for creating, discovering(mind like events), joining, and managing events with a sophisticated event ecosystem. It supports three distinct roles (Admin, Host, Client) with fine-grained access controls, secure SSLCommerz payment processing, peer-to-peer reviews with host rating aggregation, event income separation 10% admin and 90% host, comprehensive analytics dashboards,  all user management, all host management, host/ event application management and multi-template email notifications. Features interest-based event personalization, real-time event management, transactional integrity for payments and bookings, and admin-driven approval workflows for hosts and events. Built with TypeScript, Prisma/PostgreSQL, and modern Node.js best practices.

## Project Overview

- Users discover and join events based on interests.
- Hosts create/manage events, track participants, and receive payments.
- Admins oversee users, hosts, events, and system health.
- Payments processed via SSLCommerz; reviews update host ratings; dashboards expose key stats.

## Features (Detailed)

### Authentication & Roles

- JWT authentication with access/refresh tokens; HTTP-only cookies supported.
- Roles: **ADMIN**, **HOST**, **CLIENT** with route guards.
- Password hashing (bcrypt);
- Refresh token endpoint to renew sessions.

### User Profiles

- Create/update profile: name, bio, interests, location, contact number, profile photo (Cloudinary).
- View own profile; admins can list/filter users with pagination & search.

### Event Lifecycle

- Hosts: create, update, delete, complete events;
- Status flow: PENDING → OPEN → FULL / COMPLETED / REJECTED / CANCELLED.
- Capacity management: auto FULL when seats exhausted; reopen seats on leave.
- Validation: block past-date events from listings; recent events (limit 6) for landing page.
- Search & filters: searchTerm, category, date; interest-based ordering for signed-in users.

### Participation

- Clients join events (creates participant + pending payment); leave events before event date.
- ParticipantStatus respected; seat counts adjusted transactionally.
- Host/Admin can view participants (in event details page) with review status flags.

### Payments (SSLCommerz)

- Join event initiates payment; stores transactionId; links participant, event, host, client.
- Success/fail/cancel IPN handlers update PaymentStatus and event capacity/status accordingly.
- **Revenue Sharing Model**: Automatic 90/10 split on successful payments (90% to host, 10% platform fee to admin).
- Income tracking: Host and Admin models maintain cumulative `income` fields updated transactionally.
- Role-based visibility: Admin sees all payments; Host sees payments for own events.
- Search/pagination/sort on payments (transactionId, client name, status).

### Reviews & Ratings

- Clients can review hosts only after event is COMPLETED and payment is PAID.
- Prevent duplicate reviews per client per event; updates host rating aggregates.
- Latest 20 reviews endpoint for landing page.

### Analytics & Meta

- Landing stats: total events, completed events, successful payments, clients, hosts, reviews, average rating.
- Role dashboards: admin (system totals, pending apps), host (their events, revenue), client (their participation).

### Email & Notifications

- Contact form sends email to admin via `contact-email.ejs`.
- host application email, host rejection email, event payment invoice email also sent by ejs.

### Security & Middleware

- Rate limiting middleware available; centralized error handler; validation via Zod.
- Role-based auth guard; input validation; Prisma query scoping per role.

### File Handling

- Multer for upload; Cloudinary for storage; cleanup of replaced images on update where applicable.

### Pagination & Sorting

- Consistent pattern using `paginationHelper` across list endpoints; meta includes page/limit/total.

### Personalization ("mind-like" events)

- Interest-weighted event ordering for authenticated users (matches user interests to event categories).
- Recent events curated for landing; excludes past or rejected/cancelled events.
- Role-aware responses (admin vs host vs client) tailor what data and actions are available.

### Admin Controls

- Host applications: approve/reject; escalates user to Host on approval.
- Event applications: approve/reject; enforces status transitions.
- User suspension/unsuspension affecting login and visibility.
- Payment history
- Lists for hosts/clients with search, status filters, pagination.

### Guardrails & Eligibility

- Review eligibility: only after event COMPLETED and payment PAID; one review per client/event.
- Join/leave rules: cannot overbook; leaving frees seats before event date; capacity/state updates are transactional.
- Payment visibility scoped by role; host cannot see others’ event payments.
- Image replacement cleans up previous uploads where applicable.

### Validation & Error Handling

- Zod-powered request validation on inputs and multipart payloads.
- Centralized error handler with structured `ApiError` responses.
- Rate limiter middleware available for abuse protection.

## Notable Behaviors

- Event listings exclude past-date events; recent events endpoint returns 6.
- Capacity and status are kept consistent inside Prisma transactions.
- Payments are role-scoped (admin sees all; host sees own events only).
- Reviews allowed only for paid, completed events; duplicates blocked.
- Contact form emails go to admin using `contact-email.ejs`.
- once you join a event you can leave any time until the event ends but if you leave no refund policy is kept

---

## Deployment

- Designed to run on Vercel/Node with a managed Postgres
- Run `npx prisma generate` after deploying or changing the schema.
